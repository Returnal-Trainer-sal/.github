## 🧩 What Is the Returnal Trainer?

The **Returnal Trainer** is a standalone cheat tool that runs alongside the PC version of *Returnal*. It injects directly into the game process and gives you real-time control over your character’s stats, resources, weapons, and even game speed.

Unlike mods that require complex installs or game file edits, a trainer is simple: launch, toggle, dominate. Ideal for single-player exploration, story unlocks, or just having fun testing every weapon without worrying about resets.
